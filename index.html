            <p>Hi, I'm Nicole Andre Luczon from Davao, Philippines, and I'm currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying online. I'm diving into the world of web design with my WDD 130 class, and I couldn't be more thrilled!Beyond the screen, I find joy in exploring new places, capturing and editing moments through photos and videos, and spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ on social media. I love to serve others and share my talents as well. As a Primary teacher in our ward, I'm passionate about guiding children on their path to Jesus Christ. Join me on this journey of learning and discovery!</p>
